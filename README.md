## What is it?

### AmazonBrandFilter is a Firefox and Chrome add-on that filters out all of the drop shipping brands that are randomly generated and clog up your search.

## Where do I get it?
### [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amazonbrandfilter/)
### [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/amazonbrandfilter/mhfjchmiaocbleapojmgnmjfcmanihio)

## How does it work?

### It uses an Allow List over here: https://github.com/chris-mosley/AmazonBrandFilterList

The allow list can be updated any time. By default the add-on will update this list at initial startup and then once a day after that.

### Why not a block list instead of an allow list?

Because while it will certainly be a challenge and a very _very_ long road, an allow list has a hypothetical end while a block list would be impossible to "complete." They will generate brands faster than we could ever update a block list.

### Why?

Because we're all sick of crappy fake brands clogging up our search!

### Missing a Brand?

Please refer to the Submission Criteria in the AmazonBrandFilterList repo here: https://github.com/chris-mosley/AmazonBrandFilterList#submission-criteria

### Which Brands are allowed?

#### The main concern here is that this list is not a measure of "quality." Generic brands, bad brands, evil brands. The lot, they are all allowed on this list. The only thing meant to be filtered out here are the drop-shipping brands that sell random garbage.

If they have existed for more than a few years they likely belong on this list.

A good (but not foolproof) rule of thumb is that if a brand has a dedicated website, it probably belongs on this list.

### Help translate!

I didn't expect this to make it outside my home country of the USA but I'm thrilled that others are interested!  To that ends I'm hoping to accomadate as many as possible.
Unfortunately I'm monolingual and the best I could do would be to use internet translation to give crappy translations for an unknown number of languages.  

So if you would like to see your language represented.  Please translate all of the terms found in this document:


### Roadmap

In no particular order these are the things I would like to add eventually

- Per department disabling of the filter
- Caret or something on the page to indicate that things have been hidden
- A way for users to report a missing brand from within the add-on popup
- Along with localiztion I'm considering having different lists based on locale. I'm not sure it will be necessary yet.
